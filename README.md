GMLAN using VB6
===============

A simple VB6 program to test the GMLAN. Use a modified ELM327 bluetooth dongle that has the CAN IO connected to a SWCAN transceiver. You will also eventually be able to use an ELM327 chip connected to a serial->TCP/IP converter (my original plan involved using a WiFi AP in my car).

It would be awesome if someone could figure out how to display DIC text messages!

TODO
====

*   TCP/IP connectivity
*   DIC text messages
*   Other car support, framework is implemented.
*   Better message logging (popup form?)
*   Better use of bottom status bar
